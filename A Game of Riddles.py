(If you enter an answer with a negative or a decimal, the game will crash, and you will lose your progress.) You will not be told when you get a question wright or wrong. To skip a question, type skip. When you get a question right, you will gain a point. When you get a question wrong, you will lose a point. The minimum score is 0. IMPORTANT! ALWAYS ANSWER AS A DIGIT! (For example, if your answer is ten, write it like this: "10", not this: "ten". There are ten questions. Enjoy!')
